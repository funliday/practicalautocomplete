# Practical Autocomplete

This repo is the home of the Practical Autocomplete.

## Repo Layout

We use [Simple Sidebar](https://startbootstrap.com/template/simple-sidebar) as a blueprint for the structure.

### Our implementation

* `./src/pug/**/**`: contains all layout.
* `./src/markdown/locales/[lang]/**.md`: contains all translations.

## Contributing

We'd love your help refining the language of this specification, fixing typos, or adding more translations. Please don't hesitate to send a pull request.

### Adding a translation

1. Create a new file in `./src/markdown/locales/[lang]/**.md`.
2. Add lang to `./src/json/locales.json`

### Running project locally

Just use the command `npm start` to make it run locally.

Once the website will be compiled, you can see the website visiting `http://localhost:3000`
